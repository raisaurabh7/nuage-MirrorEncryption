Assignment Mirror Encryption
# 
# MirrorEncryption class includes two different approaches 
1.	Reading CSV as CSV file 
2.	Reading CSV as text file.
Reading CSV as text file is much efficient then reading as CSV file.
Apart from these two there we can also using third party library like Dask or if volume increases then can go with PySpark for distributed processing. 
For this application I have not used any third-party package.
This also includes test case
